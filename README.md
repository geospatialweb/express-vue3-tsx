# Geospatial Web

Development sandbox website to showcase the application integration of Node/Express, Vue 3 Composition API, CSS Modules with vanilla CSS, TypeScript, TSX, Mapbox GL, Deck.GL, PostGIS and Docker. This implementation features isolated Map instances in separate routes.

In essence, this implementation is a Proof of Concept and MVP Prototype that embodies what I *consider* to be the major tenets of the three leading JavaScript front-end frameworks, namely:

* Angular: TypeScript, Dependency Injection and RxJS asynchronous programming

* React: Functional components, Declarative UI and JSX/TSX

* Vue 3: Composition API, ES6 Proxy and reactive/static global state management without Vuex, Pinia or Redux

To that end, this custom *hybrid* front-end framework experiment has been an overwhelming success. Everything coalesces nicely.

Further, Vite is super fast for HMR development compilation (without Webpack and Babel), plus the new Jest-compatible Vitest unit test framework performs to expectations.

You be the judge...
