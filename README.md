# Geospatial Web

https://www.geospatialweb.ca

Development sandbox website to showcase the application integration of Node/Express, Vue 3 Composition API, CSS Modules, TypeScript, TSX, Mapbox GL, Deck.GL, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Docker and Nginx. This implementation features isolated Map instances in separate routes.

In essence, this implementation is a Proof of Concept and MVP Prototype that embodies what I *consider* to be the major tenets of the three leading JavaScript front-end frameworks, namely:

* Angular: TypeScript, Dependency Injection and RxJS asynchronous programming

* React: Functional components (React Hooks), Declarative UI and JSX/TSX

* Vue 3: Composition API, ES6 Proxy and reactive local/global state management without Vuex, Pinia or Redux

To that end, this experiment has been an overwhelming success. Everything coalesces. Vite is amazing. You be the judge...
